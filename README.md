## 💡 Why NOR?

> “The best of people are those who are most beneficial to others.” – Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

NOR was born out of **WAMYDH**, our initiative to use open-source technology in service of those often overlooked — like our brothers and sisters who walk through life without sight. We aim to offer not just utility, but **comfort, companionship, and accessibility**.

## 🕌 A Project with Purpose

NOR is more than a tool — it’s **a sadaqah jariyah (continuous charity)** in code form.  
Every voice it guides. Every verse it plays. Every time it protects someone… may it count as a deed in our scale.
